# Text Sentimental Analysis with Deep Learning Models

## Overview

Welcome to the Text Sentimental Analysis project repository! This project was developed as part of my 599 class. It delves into the realm of sentiment analysis using three powerful deep learning models: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and the Transformer, with a specific focus on the BERT model.

## Project Highlights

- **Educational Insights**: This project serves as a valuable educational resource, offering a hands-on exploration of deep learning models in the context of sentiment analysis.
- **Model Comparison**: The repository provides a detailed comparison of CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers, shedding light on their respective strengths and weaknesses.
- **BERT Model Superiority**: The project highlights the superior performance of the BERT model in sentiment analysis, showcasing its versatility and effectiveness across a range of emotions.

## Project Structure

- **General**: Simply put, all the primary scripts are within the base directory alongside the datasets.   
- **Results**: In the `results` directory, you'll find detailed reports, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score, for each model. Confusion matrices and classification reports offer a deeper understanding of model performance.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Chasinggoodgrades/TextSentimentalAnalysis.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:


3. **Explore the Models**: Dive into the project, where you'll find individual scripts for CNN, RNN, and Transformer models. Run the training, evaluation, and testing scripts to observe the models in action.

4. **Review Results**: Check the `results` directory for detailed reports on model performance. Gain insights into how each model handles different sentiments.
